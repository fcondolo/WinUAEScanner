# WinUAEScanner
WinUAE scanner is a memory watch. It helps following your variables to debug code when using WinUAE. The trick consists in reading the memory pages from WinUAE's application process and searching for data to watch. This is a very simple hack, yet helped me to quickly spot errors. Note it should work with other emulators than WinUAE.
It was made using Visual Studio / C#
